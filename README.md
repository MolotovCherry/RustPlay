# RustPlay
A desktop program for playing Rust scratch files

This program is currently alpha, but has a basic working terminal and compiles and runs rust scratches.
Currently Windows only.

### But why?
I got tired of having to go to play.rust-lang.org. I just want something I can use on my own, without limit. Something I don't need a browser for.

I am also the author of an IntelliJ rust scratch plugin, but it was too cumbersome to continue with all of their api changes. But now - now with a desktop app, there are no limits!

## Requirements
- You need to have Rust / cargo installed of course :wink:
- You use windows (Linux support will come in time)

## Current Features
- Windows support
- Faster than play.rust-lang.org, and can use any dependencies you want with zero restrictions
- Color support in terminal
- Supports cargo's building progress bar!
- Nice titlebar with tabs integrated into decoration WITH windows acrylic support (win11 only)
- Multiple tabs
- Can play scratches (very basic functionality currently)
- Nice terminal snapping close / open functionality
- Dynamic code analysis automatically infers dependencies from everywhere in your source code using your `use` statements
- - Is even smart enough to know when the crate is named `crate-name` instead of `crate_name` on crates.io and automatically fix it for you. These cases don't need a custom dependency declaration!
- For more complex needs such as specific versions and crate features, can manually include deps in cargo.toml or even whole sections of cargo.toml code

## Next Goals
- Theming with config
- Linux Support
- Rename / save / upload to play.rust-lang.org (gist creation functionality is already done)
- Project options window to configure every aspect of the rust scratch build. Will support nearly all options that the website supports!
- Possible redesign of terminal window (not sure what to do yet)
- Fix caption buttons to clip ui instead of overlay
- Clearing terminal screen
- Misc bugs such as properly switching terminal to other tabs terminal output when switching tabs
- Obvious redesign of all the buttons, including that play button. It looks wrong
- Potential caching of files / inference / cargo.toml in order to speed up runs.
- [Line numbers in code editor](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1534)
- Fix/improve svg caption button icons. They don't seem to look the same in 1080p
- Panic popup window Linux support (not sure how)
- Potential multi-file module project builds (`cargo-player` does support this)
- Cleanup old textedit state (tabs with the same node/tabindex use the same id hashes, and textedit state is persisted and not cleared when closing tabs)

## FAQ
#### Q: Why is there an error that says `use of undeclared crate`? I thought you inferred dependencies!
A: We do indeed infer and automatically include dependencies. This happened because you have an error somewhere else in your code and it failed to compile. We are unable to infer dependencies if your code does not parse correctly. You can ignore any `use of undeclared crate` errors. Just fix your code and it'll be perfect ðŸ™‚
